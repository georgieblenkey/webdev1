        <p class="grid-item text1">I use different mediums to create my art, from ink, to graphite, to acrylic paint. I use digital to traditional practices, and techniques like collage, to painting, to illustration, to printmaking. </p>
        <p class="grid-item text2">I've been making art for as long as I can remember, starting with crayons, markers, watercolors, and more In elementary school, art class has always been my favorite class because of the materials I could work with.</p>
        <p class="grid-item text3">I started making digital art around age 11 when I got my first Wacom tablet. Before that, I would make art on Microsoft Paint with my mouse. Now, I have a touchscreen tablet to make digital art even easier for me.</p>
        <p class="grid-item text4">Today, I'm also starting my journey with oil painting and I'm beginning to learn the ways that technique needs to be different than using acrylics or watercolors. Hopefully, soon I can show off my oil paintings as well.</p>
